## Project Overview

Cliff is a natural environment rendering project created with a focus on composition, vegetation systems, and realistic material design. The entire scene was rendered using Path Tracing mode in Unreal Engine to achieve cinematic visual quality.
The project began with a blockout of cliffs and mountains, followed by progressive refinement of atmosphere, vegetation distribution, and custom water shaders. The final composition integrates layered landscapes—from rocky cliffs in the foreground to forested mountains in the background—culminating in a natural lakeside vista.

## Technical Breakdown

### 01 Initial Composition Setup

- Planned the overall visual composition of the scene.
- Established the spatial relationship between the foreground cliff and the distant mountain range.

### 02 Establishing Base Atmosphere

- Replaced geometric placeholders in the foreground with detailed cliff rock meshes.
- Applied mountain materials to distant geometry to set the base mood.

### 03 Painting Background Vegetation

- Used Unreal Engine’s foliage painting tool to populate the mountain slopes with trees.

- Added large-scale forest coverage, enriching the background environment.

### 04 Adding Foreground Vegetation

- Painted grass, moss, small shrubs, and pinecones across the rocky cliff surface.

- Enhanced depth and detail by layering different vegetation types.

### 05 Water Material Development
Created a custom water shader featuring:

- Depth-based reflection and refraction for natural variation

- Flow animation for dynamic movement

- Foam and surface breakup for realism

- Applied the water material to form a lake at the base of the mountain range.

### 06 Final Scene Output

- Combined all elements—composition, vegetation, water, and lighting—into the final rendered scene.
- Rendered with Path Tracing mode for physically accurate lighting and high-quality output.


## Takeaways

1. Strengthened ability to compose large-scale natural environments, balancing foreground and background elements.
2. Gained practical experience in vegetation painting workflows for both macro (forest) and micro (cliffside) scales.
3. Developed a custom water shader with layered visual effects, enhancing realism in natural landscapes.
4. Learned to leverage Path Tracing rendering in UE for achieving cinematic-quality results.
5. Identified future opportunities to further optimize vegetation rendering for real-time performance.
