## Project Overview

This project explores the design and implementation of various subsurface scattering (SSS) materials within Unreal Engine. Materials such as skin, jade, rubber, leaves, candles, lanterns, and crystals share the unique property of being translucent—allowing light to scatter beneath the surface while remaining opaque in form. To achieve these effects, I compared and applied two shading models: Subsurface, which provides a quick solution without requiring extra assets, and Subsurface Profile, which enables finer control for subtle translucency, such as candle wax and human skin.

## Technical Breakdown

### 01 Understanding SSS Materials
Different SSS materials behave differently, requiring accurate visual representation.

- Experimented with both Subsurface and Subsurface Profile shading models to balance performance and visual quality, selecting the most suitable approach for each material type.

### 02 Candle Material
Reproducing the warm, glowing translucency of wax.

- Integrated color and normal maps

- Fine-tuned Subsurface Profile parameters to control scattering color and depth, simulating realistic candle wax thickness.

### 03 Lantern Material
Creating controllable variations in lantern translucency.

- Implemented Subsurface Color parameters and exposed them for easy adjustment of translucency color and UV mapping during scene setup.

### 04 Jade Material
Achieving the layered, multi-tonal green typical of jade.

- Combined Base Color, Normal, and Subsurface maps with baked vertex colors, using them as masks to simulate subtle color shifts in creases and surface details.

### 05 Crystal Material
Simulating realistic transparency and internal light scattering.

- Defined Index of Refraction (IOR) and roughness maps

- Created a smooth gradient of transparency, enhancing the crystal’s refractive and luminous quality.


## Takeaways

1. Gained a deeper understanding of how Subsurface vs. Subsurface Profile shaders differ, and when to apply each.
2. Developed workflows for simulating realistic translucency across multiple material types, from organic (jade, skin, wax) to inorganic (crystals).
3. Learned how to balance aesthetic fidelity and performance in translucent material rendering.
4. Enhanced ability to fine-tune parameters and expose controls, ensuring reusability and flexibility across different assets and scenes.
