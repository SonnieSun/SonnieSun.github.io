## Project Overview

Chase Animation is a cinematic chase sequence set in the world of Nexus, depicting the moment when the protagonist Molly fails her heist and leaps out of a window as enemies pursue her. The project focuses on the integration of character animation, facial capture, VFX, and post-production to create a dynamic and emotional short.
The animation was produced using Maya, Cascadeur, MetaHuman, Blender, Unreal Engine, and After Effects, blending realistic motion with stylized cyberpunk aesthetics. The result is a tightly choreographed sequence emphasizing tension, movement, and atmosphere.

## Technical Breakdown

### 01 Character Design & Rigging
- Designed a protagonist model that maintains consistency with previous projects while supporting realistic animation.

- Rigged the final mesh using the MetaHuman skeleton, ensuring smooth body deformation and compatibility with facial animation tools.

### 02 Animation Layout & Shot Planning
- Defining camera movement and timing for a fast-paced chase while maintaining readability.

- Created a layout prototype in Maya, establishing camera paths, character poses, and shot sequencing for six key shots, ensuring consistent visual rhythm across the scene.

### 03 Character Animation

- Applied MetaHuman Live Link to capture and refine realistic facial expressions matching the action’s intensity.

### 04 Glass Shatter Effect
- Simulated realistic glass breaking as Molly escapes through the window.

- Recreated the breaking effect using Niagara, adapting the fountain particle system to simulate debris spread and velocity.

### 05 Level Sequencing & Rendering

- Assembled the full sequence in Level Sequence, synchronized sound effects and camera cuts, and rendered with post-processing for consistency.

### 06 Post-Production in After Effects

- Added motion blur and subtle camera shake in After Effects, amplifying the chase’s urgency and cinematic intensity.

## Takeaways

1. Strengthened skills in cross-software animation workflow, from sculpting and cloth simulation to cinematic sequencing and post-processing.
2. Learned to integrate MetaHuman facial capture with custom body rigs for expressive storytelling.
3. Gained hands-on experience combining destruction effects, lighting, and composition into a unified cinematic pipeline.
4. Deepened understanding of camera rhythm, pacing, and visual tension for narrative animation.
5. Reinforced the connection between game development and cinematic storytelling, bridging real-time rendering and filmic presentation.
