## Project Overview

Abandoned Land is a cinematic environment project focused on creating a desolate yet mysterious landscape that combines natural elements, medieval references, and narrative-driven character design.
The project began with a blockout of the terrain and key architectural structures, gradually refined with atmospheric fog, detailed rock formations, and layered environmental materials. A custom water shader is implemented to enrich the realism of the scene.
To add narrative depth, a masked protagonist with a dynamic cloak—simulated in Marvelous Designer—was introduced as a focal point. The final presentation was captured through multi-camera sequences, highlighting different perspectives of the abandoned land and reinforcing its cinematic storytelling.

## Technical Breakdown

### 01 Basic Layout Design

- Designed and rendered multiple camera sequences to showcase the environment from various angles.
- Highlighted both wide establishing shots and close-up details to maximize cinematic storytelling.

## Takeaways

1. Strengthened skills in environment storytelling, combining natural elements, architecture, and character presence to build narrative depth.
2. Gained technical experience with water shader development for complex surface blending.
3. Practiced integrating character animation and cloth simulation into an environment-focused project.
4. Learned to use multi-camera cinematics effectively to showcase large-scale environments with emotional impact.
5. Identified opportunities to further refine performance optimization when combining dynamic cloth, complex shaders, and fog-heavy atmospheres.
