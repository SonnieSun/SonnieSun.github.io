## Project Overview

This project, Cyberpunk Cityscape – Environment & Lighting Rendering, explores the creation of a cyberpunk-inspired night city environment with a strong focus on composition, atmosphere, and material-driven visual effects.
The goal was to design a cinematic cityscape that captures the essence of a futuristic metropolis, illuminated by neon lights, holographic billboards, and animated sci-fi elements. The process began with a basic blockout of the city layout, followed by iterative refinement of lighting, fog, and model placement to establish depth and mood.
A series of custom materials and VFX were developed, including emissive window shaders, dynamic holographic projections, flowing neon road surfaces, and a sci-fi portal built in Niagara. Together, these components enhance the narrative and immerse the viewer in a visually rich cyberpunk atmosphere.

## Technical Breakdown

### 01 Basic Layout Design

- Established the overall city layout and positioned key landmark buildings.
- Added placeholder elements such as elongated white strips in the sky to represent spaceships.

### 02 Base Lighting, Fog, and City Foundation

- Introduced distance fog to create atmospheric depth and establish the overall mood.
- Added a foundational city ground plane to define spatial layers.

### 03 Replacing Key Buildings

- Swapped geometric placeholders with detailed building models.
- Adjusted placement to reinforce composition and visual hierarchy.

### 04 Completing City Blocks with Secondary Models

- Added all secondary buildings for both foreground and background districts.
- Modified materials of certain structures to better integrate them into the overall atmosphere.

### 05 Nighttime Environment Lighting

- Reduced global skylight intensity to achieve a darker night mood.
- Introduced localized light sources such as neon lamps and streetlights to enrich the scene.

### 06 Emissive Window Materials

- Result: dynamic holograms and advertising signs with strong sci-fi aesthetics.

### 08 Animated Sci-fi Roads

- Layered multiple effects for a more futuristic look.

### 09 Sci-fi Portal VFX

<img src="https://assets.sonniesun.com/p01_c_14.jpg" alt="Markdown Pic 14" style="display: block; max-width: min(100%, 600px); height: auto;" />

- Built a portal effect using Niagara particle systems in UE5.
- Combined particle swirls, energy bursts, and distortion materials to simulate a high-energy sci-fi gateway.

## Takeaways

1. Strengthened my ability to combine artistic direction with technical implementation, balancing composition, lighting, and shader work.
2. Gained experience in using fog and lighting interactions to control depth, atmosphere, and color harmony in large-scale environments.
3. Developed workflows for animated and emissive materials, as well as integrating external tools (e.g., After Effects for glitch textures, C4D for geometry emitters).
4. Explored real-time VFX design in Unreal Engine, including particle-based energy effects and material-driven distortion.
5. Reflected on the importance of performance optimization in visually complex scenes, and identified opportunities to improve efficiency in future projects.
