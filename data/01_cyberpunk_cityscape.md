## Project Overview

This project, Cyberpunk Cityscape – Environment & Lighting Rendering, explores the creation of a cyberpunk-inspired night city environment with a strong focus on composition, atmosphere, and material-driven visual effects.
The goal was to design a cinematic cityscape that captures the essence of a futuristic metropolis, illuminated by neon lights, holographic billboards, and animated sci-fi elements. The process began with a basic blockout of the city layout, followed by iterative refinement of lighting, fog, and model placement to establish depth and mood.
A series of custom materials and VFX were developed, including emissive window shaders, dynamic holographic projections, flowing neon road surfaces, and a sci-fi portal built in Niagara. Together, these components enhance the narrative and immerse the viewer in a visually rich cyberpunk atmosphere.

## Technical Breakdown

### 01 Basic Layout Design

- Established the overall city layout and positioned key landmark buildings.
- Added placeholder elements such as elongated white strips in the sky to represent spaceships.

### 02 Base Lighting, Fog, and City Foundation

- Introduced distance fog to create atmospheric depth and establish the overall mood.
- Added a foundational city ground plane to define spatial layers.

### 03 Replacing Key Buildings

- Swapped geometric placeholders with detailed building models.
- Adjusted placement to reinforce composition and visual hierarchy.

### 04 Completing City Blocks with Secondary Models

- Added all secondary buildings for both foreground and background districts.
- Modified materials of certain structures to better integrate them into the overall atmosphere.

### 05 Nighttime Environment Lighting

- Reduced global skylight intensity to achieve a darker night mood.
- Introduced localized light sources such as neon lamps and streetlights to enrich the scene.

### 06 Emissive Window Materials

- Added subtle variations in brightness and color for a more natural, lived-in effect.

### 07 Holograms & Billboards

- Designed holographic projections and animated billboards as essential cyberpunk visual motifs.
![Markdown Pic 09](https://assets.sonniesun.com/p01_c_09.png)
- Workflow example:
  - Generated glitch effects in After Effects using random seed and distortion strength parameters.
  - Integrated animated textures into Unreal Engine materials.

- Result: dynamic holograms and advertising signs with strong sci-fi aesthetics.

### 08 Animated Sci-fi Roads
![Markdown Pic 11](https://assets.sonniesun.com/p01_c_11.png)
- Modeled road structures using C4D’s Emitter system.
![Markdown Pic 12](https://assets.sonniesun.com/p01_c_12.png)
- Designed emissive road materials with animated UVs to create flowing light streaks.
![Markdown Pic 13](https://assets.sonniesun.com/p01_c_13.png)
- Layered multiple effects for a more futuristic look.

### 09 Sci-fi Portal VFX
![Markdown Pic 14](https://assets.sonniesun.com/p01_c_14.jpg)
- Built a portal effect using Niagara particle systems in UE5.
- Combined particle swirls, energy bursts, and distortion materials to simulate a high-energy sci-fi gateway.

## Takeaways

- Strengthened my ability to combine artistic direction with technical implementation, balancing composition, lighting, and shader work.
- Gained experience in using fog and lighting interactions to control depth, atmosphere, and color harmony in large-scale environments.
- Developed workflows for animated and emissive materials, as well as integrating external tools (e.g., After Effects for glitch textures, C4D for geometry emitters).
- Explored real-time VFX design in Unreal Engine, including particle-based energy effects and material-driven distortion.
- Reflected on the importance of performance optimization in visually complex scenes, and identified opportunities to improve efficiency in future projects.
